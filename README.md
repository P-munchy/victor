Welcome to `victor`. This is the home of the Anki Vector robot's source code. Original README: [README-orig.md](/README-orig.md)

## Building

Still working on that.

## Why is this not public?

Okao, TrulyHandsFree, the WWise SDK, and probably a bunch of other stuff are licensed pieces of software which really should remain somewhat confidential. They are so old that we could probably get away with it, but I don't want to risk it.
