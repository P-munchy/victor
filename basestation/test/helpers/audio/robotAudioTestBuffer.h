 * Description: This is a FIFO queue of RobotAudioFrameStreams which contain a continues stream of audio frames. The
 *              RobotAudioAnimation class will pop frames out of the RobotAudioFrameStreams and sync them with the rest
 *              of the animation tracks. Once a RobotAudioFrameStreams is empty it will be popped of the queue. The
 *              Audio Controller passes audio frames provided by the audio engine. First,  PrepareAudioBuffer() is
 *              called by the Audio Controller a new stream is created and pushed onto the back of the _streamQueue.
 *              Next, UpdateBuffer() is called by the Audio Controller to provide audio frames to the _currentStream.
 *              When all audio frames have been added to the stream the Audio Controller will called CloseAudioBuffer()
 *              to complete that stream.
