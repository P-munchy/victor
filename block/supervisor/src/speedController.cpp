 *
 * The vehicle needs to keep a forward speed as close as
 * possible to the speed commanded by the user (user means BTLE
 * Master, e.g. iPhone). There are multiple ways to
 * measure/control that speed:
 *
 * 1) The vehicle speed is measured/controlled by
 * measuring/controlling the two wheel speeds (encoders).
 * Assuming no slip, this should be very accurate and we
 * can do it many times per second. We get new measurments
 * every ~4.3mm (in version v4.1 of the car) of forward travel.
 * Also, this should work well during lane changes. With slip,
 * we loose precision, but it is probably the best way of
 * estimating forward speed at the micro level.
 *
 * 2) The vehicle speed is measured/controlled by
 * measuring/controlling the forward progress looking at track
 * codes. This is not precise at high speeds and also does not
 * really work during lane changes.
 *
 * For now, we will exclusively rely on the encoders to control
 * forward speed. At some point we MIGHT incorporate the
 * global forward speed measured via the road codes as well, but
 * only if it turns out that we need it.
