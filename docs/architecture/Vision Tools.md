# Vision Tools

The vision team has various tools it uses to aid in development:

* [DevImageCapture](DevImgeCapture.md) - a behavior for easily capturing images on the robot
* [Offboard Vision Server](Offboard%20Vision%20Server.md) - for prototyping vision algorithms running "offboard" (not on the robot)
* FaceEval - tools for evaluating face detection and recognition on a data set (TODO: needs documentation)
* VisionMarker enrollment - scripts for adding new VisionMarkers to the library
