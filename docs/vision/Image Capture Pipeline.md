# Image Capture Pipeline

Created by Andrew Stein Mar 21, 2019

The first step in vision is actually acquiring the image from the camera. This section of our space contains information related to this process, including things like:

* Debayering - Turning the raw pattern of colored pixels on the sensor into RGB or grayscale images
* Understanding camera specs, such as focal length
* Auto exposure and white balance (TODO: add documentation)
