# Object Recognition
Created by Jakob Zoepfl Nov 26, 2018

Vector creates relationships with other objects.
For example, lets say Vector's home/charger is almost always in the same spot. At this spot there is a bush within sight and Vector begins to recognize this bush since he sees it all the time. Vector can internally name it and create some type of relationship with it. May it can be random, maybe it can be based on shape but either way it can be a positive or negative relationship. Let's say Vector starts becoming friends with this bush and whenever Vector sees the bush, he is happy or tries to say something to the bush. Something quick and cute like 'hey friend! Happy to see you'. Or ' -GASP- I know you!!'.

On the other hand it can be a negative relationship. For example let's say Vector forms a relationship with this small eraser that's always on the desk Vector lives on. Vector starts to be afraid of the small eraser and gets scared when he sees it. Vector can cry out in fear, posture towards the eraser, run away, etc.

We'd want Vector to avoid making a relationship with every object he sees so there could be a hidden limit of X objects that Vector can recognize at a time. If Vector doesn't see the object in a set amount of time (let's say like 1 week) he forgets the relationship, or the relationship falls into a 'distant memory'. Just to avoid Vector recognizing everything.
