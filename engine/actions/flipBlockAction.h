 * Description: Action which flips blocks
 *              By default, when driving to the flipping preAction pose, we will drive to one of the two poses that is closest
 *              to Cozmo and farthest from the last known face. In order to maximize the chances of the person being able to see
 *              Cozmo's face and reactions while he is flipping the block
 *                - Should there not be a last known face, of the two closest preAction poses the left most will be chosen
