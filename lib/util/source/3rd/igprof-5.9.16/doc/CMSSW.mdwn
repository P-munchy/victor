### How to use IgProf in CMSSW

You can use IgProf on all platforms currently supported by CMS.
IgProf is part of the CMSSW builds, so it is automatically
in your environment after a "eval `scram runtime -[c]sh`".

### Building your own IgProf

If for some reason you need to build an IgProf other than the one
in the default CMSSW configuration, do as follows:

1. Create a CMSSW project project area if you don't already have one:

       scram project CMSSW CMSSW_3_7_0
       cd CMSSW_3_7_0/src

2. Check out the desired version of the tools:

       addpkg IgTools/Ig{Hook,Prof,Trace} Vxx-yy-zz

3. Build:

       scram b -j 10

4. Make it available in your environment:

       eval `scram runtime -sh`  # bourne shell
       eval `scram runtime -csh` # tcsh

And you are done!
