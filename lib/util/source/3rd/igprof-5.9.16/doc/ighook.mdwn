IgHook is a dynamic instrumentation library written by Lassi Tuura.  It
provides functionality to tap into any routine in an existing programme or
library, and to maintain records: capturing stack traces, efficiently keeping
track of which functions were called and how often, or keeping tabs on
resources allocated and released to find leaks.

IgHook currently works on Linux (IA32 and, mostly, X86_64) and Mac OS X (PPC).
It is used by IgProf profiling tools, but it is a general library and can be 
used for other application instrumentation purposes. In the past we have for
example used it to provide a debugging utility to dump a stack trace whenever 
an exception is thrown in an application.
