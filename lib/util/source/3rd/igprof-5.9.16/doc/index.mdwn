Welcome to IgProf, the Ignominous Profiler.  IgProf is a simple nice tool for
measuring and analysing application memory and performance characteristics.
IgProf requires no changes to the application or the build process.  It
currently works on Linux (`ia32`, `x86_64`).  Eons ago it worked also on Mac OS X
(`PPC`).

IgProf is fast, light weight and correctly handles dynamically loaded shared 
libraries, threads and sub-processes started by the application. We have
used it routinely with large C++ applications consisting of many hundreds of
shared libraries and thousands of symbols from millions of source lines of 
code. It requires no special privileges to run.  The performance reports 
provide full navigable call stacks and can be customised by applying 
filters.  Results from any number of profiling runs can be included. This 
means you can both dig into the details and see the big picture from combined 
workloads.

IgProf can be run in one of three modes: as a performance profiler, as a
memory profiler, or in instrumentation mode. When used as a performance
profiler it provides statistical sampling based performance profiles of the
application. When used as a memory profiler information about both memory leaks
and the total dynamic memory allocations are available. It can also be used to
obtain a profile the live memory allocations in the heap at any given instant
during the application run, although this requires a small code modification to
signal from within your application the appropriate time to obtain the profile.
For both profiling modes, one can produce either simple ASCII flat file or
web-navigable reports.  A complete performance and memory use picture can be
obtained by running your application twice, once in each profiling mode.
When run in instrumentation mode igprof can be used to precisely measure the
time spent in a given function with the precision of a few ns.

The performance profiling adds negligibly to application run time and 
typically adds less than 50MB to the memory usage.  The memory profiling 
overhead depends heavily on the application's memory allocation patterns: the 
smaller allocations and the 
higher the rate, the more overhead.  A fairly typical example from
our own applications, running on 64-bit Scientific Linux 5, loading some 
600 shared libraries, using 1 GB memory and allocating at roughly
a million allocations per second rate (averaged over an hour or so), the run 
time overhead is ~250% and the memory use increased by ~1 GB. On 32-bit Linux 
the overhead is much less, about ~50% increase in run time, in some cases as 
little as 15%. Usually IgProf is considerably faster than valgrind or 
callgrind for the job.

### Other profilers

Profiling is a craft art, and profilers are just tools. The best undestanding
of your application is usually achieved by correlating a number of profiling
result coming from different profilers and QA tools.
If developing on a Mac OS X is an option, even if you otherwise develop on
Linux, consider using [Instruments][].  For very precise but much more expensive
profiling you can use [callgrind and valgrind][]. If you want to get more 
down-to-the-metal information [OProfile][], Linux [perfctr][], [PAPI][] or
[perfmon2][] are other statistical profilers that use CPU performance counters;
they however require system privileges and kernel instrumentation.
