## v5.9.7

Minor relases with various cleanups and a few new features.

In particular:

- New "Empty memory mode", which can be used to identify large chuncks of
  allocated but unused memory. This can be enabled by passing `-ep`, `-eu`,
  `-ei` when running igprof (kudos to Jakob Blomer).
- If [pcre](http://www.pcre.org) is available at compilation time, you can
  collapse report nodes via the `-mr` option followed by perl like regular
  expressions (kudos to Mikko Kurkela).
- Cleanups of igprof-navigator to have less CMS-ism (kudos to Robert Lupton).
- Bug fix for a debug mode issue which could have resulted in corrupted output
  files.

For details about the new options please look at the [advaced options
page](advancedoptions.html).
