==================


-------------
On OSX
-------------

1. If you don't already have it, install Xcode 5

2. If you don't already have it, download and install Python 2.7.x . The Anaconda version is a good choice.

3. Download and install QT Open Source 4.8.6 (5.x is not supported as of April 2015). Choose your OS at
  http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.6/
  such as qt-opensource-mac-4.8.6-1.dmg

4. Install python setup tools
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
  
5. Install python packages
  sudo easy_install ipython cython pyside numpy
  
6. In python/cython, run "sudo make.sh" to build and install the anki cython packages

7. In python, type "import ankic"
  

-------------
On Windows
-------------
1. If you don't already have it, install Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010 (Not 2012 or 2013)

2. Use Windows update to update MSVC. It will probably take 3+ repetition to get all the service packs installed.

3. In Windows System Properties, copy the environment variable "VS100COMNTOOLS" to "VS90COMNTOOLS". Probably the value is something like "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\"

4. Download and install Anaconda python 2.7, 32-bit version (version 2.2 works, and probably others do)

5. Download and install QT Open Source 4.8.6 (5.x is not supported as of April 2015). Choose your OS at
  http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.6/  
  such as qt-opensource-windows-x86-vs2010-4.8.6.exe
  
6. Build the coretech-external libraries using 
  cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 10" -DBUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF

7. In python/cython, run "make.bat" to build and install the anki cython packages

8. In python, type "import ankic"
