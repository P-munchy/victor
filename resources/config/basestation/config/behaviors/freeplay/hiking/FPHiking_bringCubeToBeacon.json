//
// Hiking_BringCubeToBeacon
// This behavior triggers whenever we don't have cubes in beacons or we need to move a cube to a specific beacon. It
// should not be responsible for picking when to activate a new beacon (ThinkAboutBeacons), but it can be responsible
// for selecting the cube to move, or the location to drop it inside the beacon.
