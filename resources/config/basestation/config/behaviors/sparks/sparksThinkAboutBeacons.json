//
// sparksThinkAboutBeacons
// This behavior is meant so that Cozmo can make decisions about beacons, for example, when to select a new one,
// where to put it, etc. I want it to be a behavior rather than a module somewhere else in the AI so that we
// can play animations during the thinking process if required, to both show intent and to not look dead while
// thinking (in the case that it ever took some time to figure out what we want to do.)
