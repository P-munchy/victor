  // have an anonymous trigger word detector behavior here on the stack ready to go
  // default reaction for this behavior is disabled
  // each phase behavior can set a reaction if they so choose

  // OR

  // each phase can have their own trigger word detector behavior and check for WantsToBeActivated() within it's class

  // ... just depends on if each behavior requires specific configs????
  //     ideally we never want to do this, as their priority on the stack will be different, meaning a higher behavior
  //     could kick the trigger word off the stack which is one of the problems we were solving in the first place

  // OR

  // have the phases that actually need a trigger word detector be DispatcherStrictPriority (like they are now)
  // and have the trigger word at the bottom of their stack
  // ... fuck that was too easy, TeachMeetVictor just needs to be a dispatcher like the others
