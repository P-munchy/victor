 * Modified extensively for a different ROM selection process and flash operation.
 * @author Daniel Casner
 *
 * The original rBoot selected one of a number of complete images to map and 
 * execute based on a configuration section in flash.
 * This version instead looks at configuration to determine if a newer image has
 * been written by over the air update and overwrites the existing image with
 * the new one if nesissary. This allows the program to be linked once against
 * a specific address point and also allows the remainig flash to be used for
 * assets etc. when not being used for an OTA update.
