 * Author: Kevin Yoon
 * Created: 6/23/2014
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   Controller for playing animations that comprise coordinated motor, light, and sound actions.
 *
 * Update: Andrew Stein, 6/22/2015
 *   Updating to support streaming animations from Basestation instead of a set of static, 
 *   canned animations stored on the Robot.
 *
 * Update: Daniel Casner, 10/23/2015
 *   Refactoring to run buffer and spooling on the Espressif with most of the execution happening on the K02
