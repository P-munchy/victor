# Cozmo SDK

## Getting Started

The SDK needs the Python build of CLAD that match the build of the app 
that's running on your device.  Those files should be installed into 
`cozmo/_internal/clad`.

Start the USB Mux TCP relay before running an example using the `run-example.sh`
script.

## Coding Standards

Code should roughly comply with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

All public classes, methods, functions and attributes must have a docstring
(except for auto-generated entries such as animation trigger attributes).

The documentation format currently follows the Google style guide.  For example:

```python
def fetch_bigtable_rows(big_table, keys, other_silly_variable=None):
    """Fetches rows from a Bigtable.

    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
    represented by big_table.  Silly things may happen if
    other_silly_variable is not None.

    Args:
        big_table: An open Bigtable Table instance.
        keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row
            to fetch.
        other_silly_variable: Another optional variable, that has a much
            longer name than the other args, and which does nothing.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
        fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
        example:

        {'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
         'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
         'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

        If a key from the keys argument is missing from the dictionary,
        then that row was not found in the table.

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred accessing the bigtable.Table object.
    """
    pass
```

In addition, documentation can include cross-references to other classes,
methods, funcs, etc that Sphinx can extract:

* Modules - ``:mod:`cozmo.robot` ``
* Exceptions - ``:mod:`cozmo.RobotBusy` ``
* Classes - ``:class:`cozmo.robot.Cozmo` ``
* Methods - ``:meth:`cozmo.robot.Cozmo` ``.
* Functions - ``:func:`cozmo.connect` ``.
* Attributes - ``:attr:`cozmo.robot.Cozmo.world` ``

The cross-referenced name can be left unqualified if it references a name
in the current module.

The name can be prefixed with ~ to only display the final component.

## Building The Docs

The docs are currently auto-generated by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

```bash
pip install Sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
cd docs
make html
open buid/html/index.html
```
