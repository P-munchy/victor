# Vector SDK

The Python SDK currently lives under `tools/sdk/vector-sdk/`. Instructions to
use the SDK can be found [on confluence](https://ankiinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VD/pages/441319496/Python+Vector+SDK+-+Getting+Started).

## grpc_tools
The `grpc_tools` directory is mainly useful for the Makefile contained within.
Everything in there is intended to be a temporary band aid until better processes
exist. Further details may be found [in grpc_tools's README](grpc_tools/README.md)
