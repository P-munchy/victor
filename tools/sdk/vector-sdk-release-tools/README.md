# Vector Python SDK Build Tools

To release a new version of the SDK, follow the steps below.

These instructions build the SDK and its documentation and produce a compressed file.


# Pre-Requisites

* You have ota'd your robot to Victor OS 1.0.1 or later. (TODO: test multiple OS versions? Test latest OS?)
* Uninstall any existing representation of the SDK from your computer.
* You have Python 3.6.1 or later already installed.
* Decide what version you want to increase the Python SDK to.


# Build the SDK Artifacts

1. Pull latest victor repo's master branch.

2. Delete all local files from `victor/tools/sdk/vector-sdk/` and `victor/cloud/gateway/` by wiping dirs then reverting them entirely:
    cd victor
    git checkout -- tools/sdk/vector-sdk/
    git clean -f -d -x tools/sdk/vector-sdk/
    git checkout -- cloud/gateway/
    git clean -f -d -x cloud/gateway/

3. On victor master branch, delete `victor/tools/sdk/vector-sdk/tests` folder as we don't want to ship this folder.
    cd victor
    rm -rf tools/sdk/vector-sdk/tests

4. On victor master branch, from the following files, remove all messages marked "App only". This removes proto messages
that we don't want to expose. Do not commit these changes to victor master.

  `cloud/gateway/external_interface.proto` (Keep the ending curly brace)
  `cloud/gateway/messages.proto`
  `cloud/gateway/onboardingSteps.proto`
  `cloud/gateway/settings.proto`
  `cloud/gateway/shared.proto`

5. Run `victor/tools/sdk/scripts/update_proto.sh`

6. Pull latest `vector-python-sdk-private` master branch.

7. Create a branch off master in`vector-python-sdk-private` named `release/{version}`.

8. Delete all local files from `vector-python-sdk-private`. Do not revert.

9. Copy contents of `victor/tools/sdk/vector-sdk/` to `vector-python-sdk-private`.

10. Locally delete `anki_vector/messaging/.gitignore` from repo `vector-python-sdk-private`

11. In `vector-python-sdk-private` repo:
    ** update version in `anki_vector/version.py`
    ** Update version throughout docs, like on Mac, Win and Linux install pages.

12. In `vector-python-sdk-private` repo, navigate to `docs` and run: `make html`.

13. Use the diff of all files in the repo to help collect release notes if you don't have them already.

14. Copy contents of `vector-python-sdk-private` repo to new folder outside of your repo named `vector_python_sdk_{version}` (e.g., vector_python_sdk_0.4.0).
    * Do not copy over .git folder.

15. Compress folder `vector_python_sdk_{version}` repo into `.zip` and `.tar` by running the following commands:
      `zip -r vector_python_sdk_{version}.zip vector_python_sdk_{version}`
      `tar -zcvf vector_python_sdk_{version}.tar.gz vector_python_sdk_{version}`


# Test the Build

Test the compressed files.

1. Uncompress and open documentation:

```bash
$ cd vector_python_sdk_{version}
$ open docs/build/html/index.html
```

2. Test SDK Installation and Vector Authentication following the instructions in the docs, ideally including running configure.py with an MP robot (or `configure_dev.py` from `victor/tools/sdk` if necessary).

3. Test all tutorials and apps (excluding sign language).


# Push the Release Commit To Master and Tag

In `vector-python-sdk-private` repo, validate reasonable diff, commit and push.

Add tag in `vector-python-sdk-private` repo against tip (which represents release) with version number.
$ git tag -a {version} -m "Release of {version}"
$ git push origin master --tags
