# Anki Vector - Python SDK

## Getting Started

Begin by setting up victor to have a running `vic-gateway` (See `tools/sdk/grpc_tools`).

To start running the sdk examples,
* Install python3 if it's not available: `brew install python`

Either:
* Download the required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
Or:
* Install the vector sdk using `setup.py`: `pip3 install -e .`.

## Tests

Note: The tests need to be updated to use grpc before they will be functional again.
