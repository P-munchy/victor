^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Vector Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To authenticate with the robot, type the following into the Terminal window::

    cd vector-sdk
    ./configure.py

You will be prompted for your robot's name, ip address and serial number. You will also be asked for your Anki login and password.

.. note:: Running `configure.py` will automatically download the Vector robot certificate to your computer and store credentials to allow you to connect to Vector. These credentials will be stored under your home directory in folder `.anki_vector`.

.. warning:: These credentials give full access to your robot, including camera stream, audio stream and data. Do not share these credentials.

Extra Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few extra packages that must be installed to run the experimental examples. To install these dependencies, enter this command::

    cd vector-sdk
    pip3 install .[experimental]
