A Node.js app to talk to Victors over BLE

## Installation

## Configuring WiFi

First, power on the victor and wait about 1 minute to get it to start advertising via BLE.  Then


```sh
bash$ node ./index.js
victor-ble-cli$ scan

## Wifi Connection

To connect your robot to wifi, run the script 
```sh
./vic_join_wifi.sh <VICTOR_NNNNNNNN>
```
which will connect your robot to the AnkiTest2 network with a dynamic IP.


If your robot has an entry in vic_join_wifi.sh for connecting to AnkiRobots (with a static IP) use the following syntax:

```sh
./vic_join_wifi.sh <Robot Letter>
```
NOTE: The script is a little brittle. It works best when run about 10 seconds after the robot ID appears on victor's face, after boot.
If there is no configuration for your robot you may need to add one; currently our limit is 10 static robot IPs.
