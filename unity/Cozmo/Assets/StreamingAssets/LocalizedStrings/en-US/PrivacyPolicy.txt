privacy policy
UPDATED JULY 27, 2017
We at Anki, Inc. ("Anki," "we", "our" or "us") take your privacy seriously. This policy explains our collection and use of information on and through our websites, products, services, and applications (the “Services”), and related choices you have. By using or accessing the Services, you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information as described herein. 

Your use of the Services is at all times subject to the Anki Terms of Use, which incorporate this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use. 

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting a notice within the Services, sending you an email, and/or by some other means. If required, we may also seek your or your parent or guardian’s prior consent. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for changes. If you use the Services after changes have been posted, that means you agree to them.

A. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED 
We and the Services collect different types of information through the Services, with some fields required and some optional.
1.	GENERAL INFORMATION
Personal information is information about you that can be used by itself, or combined with other information, to personally identify you (“Personal Information”). We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us and by other means. For example, when you make a purchase on our website, you provide us with your name, email, phone number, address and billing information, and other information you input. When you register to receive Anki news, we collect your age and email address.  We do not collect more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or improve the Services.
2.	SPECIFIC TO THE SERVICES
●	ACCOUNT INFORMATION
When you sign up for an Anki account (an "Account"), we may collect information such as your name, player/driver name, email address, birthdate, password, address, and billing information (collectively, “Account Information”). If a child under the age of 13 registers for an Account, the email address of his or her parent/legal guardian is collected instead. 

We use Account Information to create, manage, and maintain Accounts and provide the Services. For example, for Anki OVERDRIVE, your driver name will be displayed to users you play with. We also use your Personal Information to back up stats, track progress on multiple devices, and reserve a unique driver name. We collect address and billing information to facilitate your current or future purchases.
●	ANALYTICS DATA
We collect gameplay data such as scores, achievements, and feature usage. The Services also automatically record information such as events or failures within them. In addition, we may collect your device make and model, randomized device ID for the mobile device on which you run our apps, robot/vehicle ID of your Anki device, Geolocation Data (as defined below), operating system version, and other device-related information like battery level (collectively, “Analytics Data”). This Analytics Data is stored under an anonymized unique ID and not connected to your name. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) address, and for our website, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, pages or items viewed, and/or clickstream data.  We use Analytics Data to enable and improve the Services and enhance your gameplay. For example, Analytics Data enables us to analyze crashes, fix bugs, and personalize or develop new features and services.

We may also use Analytics Data, either alone or combined with other data, to create aggregated, anonymized data (“Aggregate Data”), which does not identify you personally.  We may freely use and share Aggregate Data with our partners, for example, who perform functions on our behalf or help us improve the Services. If you are a user in Germany, you can opt-out from the collection of Analytics Data. For further information, please see Section E.
●	COZMO DATA
Cozmo connects to his app via a direct Wi-Fi connection to your mobile device. Images from Cozmo's camera are processed in the Cozmo app to power his navigation and other features. They are not stored and do not leave the Cozmo app. When you use Cozmo, the Cozmo app may translate pictures of faces Cozmo sees into encoded facial features, a set of numbers not recognizable by a person (“Facial Features Data”). Unless you play Meet Cozmo (as described below), Facial Features Data is discarded each time Cozmo goes to sleep or loses his connection to your mobile device.  

Meet Cozmo 

If you use the Meet Cozmo section of your Cozmo App, Cozmo can learn to associate a name you provide with Facial Features Data for a particular face across play sessions. If you have signed up through Meet Cozmo, Facial Features Data is stored with your player name, and used to enhance and personalize your gameplay and do things like greet you by your player name. This data resides locally on the Cozmo robot and in the Cozmo app. It is not uploaded to Anki nor shared, and you can delete it anytime by visiting the Meet Cozmo section of your Cozmo App. 
●	OTHER FEATURES
The Services may provide you with options to share your information, such as via text messaging, email, or social media, or to receive push notifications from us. For example, the Services may ask if you'd like to share your play results with your friends or save images from our apps to your device. If you want to use these features, you will receive a request for access to your photos which you may allow or deny. If granted, we use this access to save images you create within the Services. For push notifications, you can opt-out anytime by turning off push notifications from your phone settings. 

Our applications may also request permission to use Bluetooth on your device. For example, the applications use Bluetooth to communicate with Anki vehicles and other in-game devices during gameplay. You can turn on / off Bluetooth at the device level.

With your devices' IP addresses we obtain zip-code level geographic information, which is then stored under an anonymized unique ID (“Geolocation Data”). If you are a user in Germany, you may opt-out from us collecting Geolocation Data from the settings sections of our applications (see also Section E below).

3.	AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU NAVIGATE: LOG FILES, COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
When you use or visit the Services, certain information is or can be automatically recorded and stored in log files. Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way. If we need to combine this type of information with Personal Information, we treat it as Personal Information. Automatically collected information includes statistical or technical information such as your Internet Protocol address, operating system, time and date, and how you navigate the Services.

Information may also be automatically collected via “Cookies” or similar tracking technologies, which are identifiers we transfer to your browser that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us when pages and features are visited and by how many people. Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. We use various types of Cookies to improve our Services. On our site, our service providers may also use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of Cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Every browser being different, you can verify in the "help" menu of your browser how to modify your Cookie preferences. Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Although your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, our Services do not support “Do Not Track requests” at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave the Services. In France, duration of Cookies does not exceed 13 months.
  
We partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies on our and other sites (but not in our mobile applications), to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests or display ads that link back to our site. If you wish to opt out of interest-based or retargeted advertising click here [or if located in the European Union click here].  
4.	EMAIL, SURVEYS, AND YOUR CHOICES
If you have provided us with your contact information, we may use this information to communicate with you about your order or Account or address your questions. If you have, or, for a child under the age of 13, his or her parent/legal guardian has, given us consent by providing us your contact information, we may, subject to your marketing preferences, send you education, marketing, product support, and research emails. Our third-party mail service provider provides us with anonymized and aggregated information about the respondents to our emails. You can unsubscribe from our marketing and research emails anytime by following the instructions included in them. We track open rates for our emails so we can improve our communications with you and our services. If you participate in our optional surveys, information you provide to us, including Personal Information, will be linked with your Account. We will not share the Personal Information you provide through a contest or survey with third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.
5.	SOCIAL MEDIA & CONTESTS
We have a presence on various social media platforms, such as Facebook. We receive anonymized and aggregated demographic and use information from these services when you engage with us on them. In addition, we may offer sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button). Such integrated features may share data and are governed by the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features. From time to time, we may conduct contests and sweepstakes. If you participate, we may collect information from you, as described in the terms of the contest or sweepstakes.
