Please read on to learn more about our collection and use of information on and through our website(s), products, services and applications (the "Services").  By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information as described herein.

A.  TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE INFORMATION
We collect several types of information through the Services:

1.  General information collection
Personal information is information about you that can be used by itself, or combined with other information, to personally identify you ("Personal Information"). We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us and by other means.

When you purchase an Anki product from our website, you provide us with your name, email, phone number, shipping and billing addresses, credit card information, and other information you affirmatively provide. When you register to receive Anki news we collect your age and email address. 

If you choose to purchase an Anki product as a gift and send it to a third party, we will ask you for friend or family member's name and shipping information. We do not use the shipping information for any secondary purpose.
We do not collect more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Services or improve the Services.

2.  Specific to the Services

- Sign-up for an Account (Account Information)
When you sign up for an Anki account (an "Account"), we may collect Personal Information and other information such as your name, driver name (please do not use your real name), email address, birthdate, password, address and billing information ("Account Information"). If a child under the age of 13 registers for an Account, the email address of his or her parent/legal guardian is collected instead.  When you create an Anki account, you can store your address and other billing information to make purchases.  

What do we use this data for?

When you sign-up for an Account, we use your Account Information to create this Account and to maintain and manage it for you. For example, your driver name will be displayed to other Anki users you play with. We also use your Personal Information to backup stats, track progress on multiple devices and reserve a unique driver name. We collect your address and other billing information to facilitate current or future purchases.

- Analytics data

We collect gameplay data such as game scores, game achievements, game performance, and your usage of various game features. We also automatically record information such as how often you use the Services, the events that occur within the Services and usage and performance data. 

In addition, we may collect your device make and model, randomized device ID, vehicle ID, Geolocation Data (as defined below), operating system version and language your device is set to, as well as other device-related information like the battery level and the disk usage (collectively, "Analytics Data"). This Analytics Data is not connected to your name but stored under an anonymized unique ID.  
This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

What do we use this data for?

Analytics Data is used by us to enable usage of the Services, enhance your gameplay experience, and help improve our products and services. For example, it enables us to develop new features, to analyze crashes or to fix bugs that occurred within the Services and to develop new products and services. 
We may also use Analytics Data, either alone or combined with other data and information, to create aggregated, anonymized data ("Aggregate Data"), which does not identify you personally.  We may freely use and share this Aggregate Data, for example, by posting it on publicly-accessible web sites such as Facebook and sharing it with hardware manufacturers, developers, platform hosts and marketing partners.

If you are a user in Germany, you can opt-out at any time from the collection of Analytics Data. For further information on how to opt-out please see Section E below.

- Cozmo facial recognition data

If you use Cozmo, it may collect data that allows it to recognize certain users’ facial features.  Cozmo does this by sending a picture of the faces it sees with its built-in camera to the Cozmo application via Wi-Fi which then translates the picture into binary encoded facial features that are not recognizable by a person ("Facial Recognition Data").  Once this translation occurs, the Facial Recognition Data is sent back to the Cozmo unit and stored there for comparison to other faces it sees in the future.  We also may collect a player name (e.g., first name) which can be associated with the faces that Cozmo recognizes ("Player Name Information").

What do we use this data for?

Facial Recognition Data and Player Name Information are used by Anki to allow Cozmo to identify faces to enable personalized usage of Cozmo and enhance your gameplay experience, such as to greet you by your first name.  It is not shared with any third parties, and Facial Recognition Data and Player Name Information are stored only on the Cozmo unit. The information is not uploaded back to Anki’s web servers.

- Other features of the Services

Some features of the Services may provide you with options to share your information via text messaging, email, or social applications you have on your mobile device.  For example, the Services may allow you to share your race results with your friends. You may have the ability to save images to your device in our sharing of results feature. If you wish to do so, you will receive a notification indicating that the Services would like to access your photos which you may allow or deny. We only allow you to save the image you create within the Services to your device and we do not access other photos that you may have saved to your device.

With your devices' IP addresses we obtain zip-code level geographic information (which is not connected to your name but instead stored under an anonymized unique ID) ("Geolocation Data"). If you are a user in Germany, you may opt-out from us collecting Geolocation Data by visiting the setting sections of our application (see also Section E below).

If you opt-in to receive push notifications, we may send you notifications regarding service updates and other relevant messages.  You may opt-out of receiving these at any time by going to the phone settings and turning them off.
Our applications may also request permission to use Bluetooth on your device. The applications use Bluetooth to communicate with Anki vehicles and other in-game devices during gameplay. You can turn on / off Bluetooth at the device level.

3.  Automatically as you navigate through the Site: log files, cookies and other technologies

When you visit the Services, certain information is or can be automatically recorded and stored in log files. Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way. If we need to combine this type of information with Personal 

Information, we treat it as Personal Information. Automatically collected information includes:

(a) Statistical or technical information such as your computer or device's Internet Protocol address, operating system and browser type, time and date, and how you navigate through and interact with the Services.

(b)  Information collected via "Cookies" or similar tracking technologies, which are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people ("Cookie Information").  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.  Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.   Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support DO Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave the Services.  Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we are not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.  Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor "Do Not Track" requests you have set using your browser or device.  

Our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyse trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising visit http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ [or if located in the European Union visit http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/]. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads. 

4.  Emails and other communications and your choices

If you have provided us with your contact information, we may use this information to communicate with you about your order or Account, or to address your questions.
If you have, or, in case of a child under the age of 13, his or her parent/legal guardian has, given us consent by providing us your contact information, we may from time to time, subject to your marketing preferences, send you education, marketing, product support, and research emails. Our third-party mail service provider provides us with anonymized and aggregated demographic information about the respondents to our emails. You can unsubscribe from our marketing and research emails by following the instructions included in them. In addition, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. 

We may also ask you to participate in surveys. These surveys are purely optional and help us improve our products and provide aggregate information, which we think may interest our registered users and visitors. If you choose to participate in an Anki survey, any information you provide to us, including Personal Information, will be linked with your Account in our system and to any Personal Information contained therein. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

5.  Social media

We have a presence on various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. We receive from them anonymized and aggregated demographic and use information related to our presence on the respective social media platform when you choose to visit us on those sites or to communicate with us.
From time to time, we may conduct contests and sweepstakes on our social media channels or in cooperation with other partners. If you choose to participate in such contests and sweepstakes, we may collect information from you, as described in the terms of the respective contest or sweepstakes.
In addition, we may, from time to time, offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take on the Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides these features. These features may also collect your IP address, which page you are visiting and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features. 

B.  HOW WE USE THIS INFORMATION

F.  CHILDREN

The Services are intended for audiences of all ages including children under 13 (referred to as "child" or "children" in this Privacy Policy). In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), when we collect Personal Information, we will ask users of the Services to input their age.

If a child signs up for an Account, his or her parent or legal guardian will be provided with notice via email and the parent/legal guardian must approve the Account before it is activated, or, we may choose to obtain verifiable consent of the parent/legal guardian via other acceptable methods. If no consent is received within 14 days after sign-up, the child's Account will be deleted.

The Personal Information collected and stored from the child (with permission of the parents/legal guardians) may include a username (e.g., driver name), Account password, parent’s/legal guardian's email address, and age/date of birth (as noted above). We may also collect and link to the child’s Account the information we store within the analytics software.

The child’s Personal Information will be used for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, as permitted under COPPA. The child’s Personal Information may also be shared as described in Section C, including sharing with certain third party vendors that help us operate the Services, such as send out email communications to users or process Account information for internal purposes.
 
We will only collect such Personal Information from children as is reasonably necessary to provide the features and services of the Services. When applicable, parents/legal guardians have the right to consent to Anki's collection and use of Personal Information from the child without also consenting to its disclosure to independent third parties. 

If a parent or legal guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without the parent's/legal guardian's consent or the parent/legal guardian wishes to revoke his/her prior consent, the parent/legal guardian should contact us at privacy@anki.com or as mentioned in Section J. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time. The parent/legal guardian may also contact us to review, modify, delete, or stop Anki’s continued use or collection of their child’s Personal Information.

Alternatively, a parent or legal guardian may contact us by sending a letter to:

If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children's Personal Information to which a parent/legal guardian has previously consented, the parent/legal guardian will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent's/legal guardian's additional consent.

We will notify the parent/legal guardian when important information changes, like e.g. when password changes, purchases or other settings changes are made to Accounts from children under the age of 13.

We encourage parents to talk with their children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online.

G.  SECURITY

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Information. We use reasonable industry standard practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. All information you provide to us is secured using industry standard procedures. Any payment transactions will be encrypted in transit using SSL.
