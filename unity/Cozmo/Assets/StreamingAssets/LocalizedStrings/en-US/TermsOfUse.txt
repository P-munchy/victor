TERMS OF USE 

Updated August 2017

This is a binding contract between you and Anki, Inc. (with its affiliates, "Anki", "we" and "us") and describes the rules and restrictions that apply to our websites, products, and services, including the Anki OVERDRIVE and Cozmo devices and their associated applications (the "Services"). Please read these Terms carefully. These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, limitations of liability, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of by litigation in court.

By using the Services, you agree to be bound these terms, the Anki Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy, as well as other rules, policies, and other terms available through the Services (collectively, "Terms"). If you do not accept the Terms, then you do not have a right to use the Services, and you may return the products if allowed under the applicable return policy. If you reside in France or Germany, some of these terms do not apply to you. Please scroll to the end of
these Terms for additional terms.

You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and that you won't use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content (which may be Anki or our licensors) or (ii) in a way that violates someone else's (including Anki's) rights. 

You understand that Anki exclusively owns the Content and the Services and intellectual property in them (except that you own your User Submissions and physical hardware devices you have purchased, but not software or other materials we may license to you under these Terms even if such materials reside on your devices).

7.	Content You Provide. Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide to us and/or our sites through the Services, including through our Software Development Kit ("SDK"), is your "User Submission." You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so. Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. We do not regularly review User Submissions, but reserve the right to remove or edit content you submit, including to enforce these Terms. For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Anki a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on a mobile device), reproduce, and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate and improve your experience and the Services. This is a license only â€“ your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.  The licenses you grant to us (and by extension to our users) through these Terms are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, unless the Services indicate otherwise.

8.	Feedback & Public Postings; Unsolicited Ideas. If you share a User Submission in a manner that more than just you can view, then you grant Anki the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute the Content you submitted for the purpose of making it accessible to all Anki users and providing the Services necessary to do so.  We do not consider unsolicited feedback, proposals, or ideas for products, services, or technology improvements.  If you send us such feedback anyway through the Services and/or directly to us, you grant us all the licenses in this section, and agree that your idea is not confidential and that your submitting such feedback does not create an obligation on us to you. 

9.	Third Parties. Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person that originated it, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren't liable for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. The Services may also contain links or connections to third party websites or services not owned or controlled by Anki, and using the Services may require you to transact with third parties, such as for your internet connection. Anki is not responsible for these third-party services or individuals that you may interact with through the Services. 

If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, Anki is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users or third parties, you release Anki, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."

10.	Online Orders. We reserve the right to cancel or modify orders for any reason. For example, we may refuse to ship to known freight forwarders or if we suspect fraud or abuse or any violation of these Terms. We also may change our prices (but we wonâ€™t change the price once your order has been confirmed), the availability of products, or make other updates.

11.	Products Warranty. For warranty information regarding Anki-branded hardware product and accessories, please visit anki.com/returns-warranty. The warranty does not apply to software.

16.	Choice of Law. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

17.	Arbitration. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH ANKI AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, either you or Anki may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.

Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ANKI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Both you and Anki acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Anki's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors ("Personnel") are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

Arbitration Opt-Out: You have the right to opt out of the foregoing arbitration provision by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Anki, Inc., 55 2nd St., 15th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Section's arbitration agreement. If you send this notice, and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration provision permits either you or Anki to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration provision will not apply to either party and both you and Anki agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively San Francisco County, California.

18.	Miscellaneous. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Anki agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Anki, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Anki, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Anki in any respect whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the section regarding Apple, you and Anki agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
